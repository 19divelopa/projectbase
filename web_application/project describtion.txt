The web application is a staff puntuality record system for primary aand secondary schools that takes the record of staffs attendants for the month,
and then compute the most puntual staff of the month and therefore allocate a bonus salary to the staff based on the puntuality off the staff.

How it works
The staffs register on the registeration page and an ID is allocated to that staff(A 3 Alpha numeric ID)for fast login time
and to save the use of name especially long names.
i.Every morning the staffs login with their ID and the application automatically takes the login time and saves it on the databse
(Note:No staff can login twice a day)
ii.At afternoon the staff log out, that is during dismissal time and the process above(i) is repeated again
(Note:No staff can perform the same process twice on the same day,the program flags a warning until the next day.)

After a month the Admin then logs into the Admin page on the application(Note: the program retrieves the data form the database and then translate it to a user
friendly interface  for the Admin to easily understand )
i.The app compute each staffs time record for the Admin to see for every login/logout record of the staff and their dates respectively

ii.it then represent the percentage of puntuality and a color representation of the percentage
(Red for staff poor time record,and yellow, green for better performances)
ii.Allocate a bonus reward payment for puntual staff  .
